Home Music Gear brings you reviews, guides and tips for getting the most out of your music gear!
{{< /lead >}}

Hi welcome to [Home Music Gear](https://homemusicgear.com), my name is Chris and I have been passionate about music gear now for almost as long as I can remember.  I started this site to review some of my favorite music gear and to share that content with other people in the hope that it would be helpful.  My reviews and guides are my honest opinion of these products.

Explore the [sample pages]({{< ref "samples" >}}) to get a feel for what Congo can do. If you like what you see, check out the project on [Github](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) or read the [Installation guide]({{< ref "docs/installation" >}}) to get started.
